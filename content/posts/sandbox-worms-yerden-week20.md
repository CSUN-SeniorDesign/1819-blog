Due to personal reasons, I was not able to attend the classes and commit appropriate time towards project. However, for this week I have challenged myself working with LAMP stack simply because I had very little experience with it. I have researched on how to install LAMP stack and practiced it on VirtualBox using Ubuntu 18.04. Later on, I found out that I missed in class assignment related to LAMP and caught up on that one as well. 
The first sprint as a new team was a little bit unorganized with lack of communication. However, I think this aspect would be easily improved over the next sprints. This is my last semester as undergrad at CSUN and as it gets busier the more pressure I feel.
