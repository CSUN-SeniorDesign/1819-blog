This is the first time that we are going to be suggesting our planned work. We made sure that we speak with all the stakeholders of the project. Professor Nerces has been kind enough to talk to us for few minutes to give some feedback and his insight about the project. 

We, CIT Senior design, have decided on some of the stuff that we planned to do short term and long term. We also spoke with the developers and have found out some of their goals.

We plan to demonstrate how we can help the development of the project. Based on our meeting, the developers will be using MongoDB, NodeJS, Angular and Express. This is exciting for us because we will be able to apply most of the technologies and concepts that we have learned in the first 8 weeks.

Based on our initial research, developing in NodeJS requires different tools to build the application. I am hoping that we will be able to implement a multi-stage build in docker. A build where we only take the necessary binaries in the release state to keep the image small. I am also hoping that we can utilize docker in such a way that it will also help our developers have a consistent environment to build their codes.
