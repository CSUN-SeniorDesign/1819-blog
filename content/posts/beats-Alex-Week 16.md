## Week 16 - First week of final semester
It is now week 16 and we are back at working on the SAPS. We already have a robust infrastructure implemented and documented. We have been integrating with both of the other SAPS teams well and we expect that to continue. I expect it will be within this next cycle that things pick up. We are still waiting for dummy data to use with an API to replicate real API calls that students would be making. In the meantime there is still some tasks we have to complete. We have gotten in touch with the other teams that are working on the SAPS project. We will likely have some meetings next week. Once everyone is refreshed on the current state we can move forward.

The following are my tasks for the first sprint:

- Add nameservers to NameCheap domain hosting interface
- Document Application Load Balancer
- Document Access Log Bucket
