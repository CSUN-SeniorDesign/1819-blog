After spending some time watching Kubernetes videos on Lynda.com I found that most of the material about the set up and deployment configurations are done through aws console which is not the way we need to get it working. During the class Neel shared a helpful link that had a detailed step by step instructions on Kubernetes deplyment. 
First, I have created and attached IAM policies to the new worskapce. Then all necessary Kubernetes tools were instaled, git repo cloned and ssh key generated. 
Then, I had to download esktl (CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS) and then by running "esktl create cluster --name" created a cluster on my local machine.
Looking forward playing with the rest confugurations over the weekend.
