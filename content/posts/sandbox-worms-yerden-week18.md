After the new machines were installed and tested our team moved on the next step, transferring needed configurations. I have been tasked to find a safe way to transfer our DNS configurations into our new machines. I was recommended to try Secure File Protocol which allow to transfer files securely between two hosts remotely. I have practiced SCP on VMs to avoid any failure on AdvTech side. 
Also, I came up with decision to switch to a new group that will be working on AWS to practice skills learned from last semester.
