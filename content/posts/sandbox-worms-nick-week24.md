The week started off a bit rough since we had a presentation on the first day back from Spring break. Plus, Neel couldn't make it since he had to attend a funeral in San Diego, but thankfully we were able to get slides prepared in time. For this next sprint, we'll be focusing on getting our elastic loab balancer working and trying to figure out how to get SSL for port 443 on the ELB. The professor was also nice enough to give me some AWS credit so I'll have to focus on spinning up our environment on my AWS account. We haven't merged our accounts and not sure if we will so for now we'll continue to work in our accounts. There's about one month left to finish out the semester so I doubt we'll be merging our AWS accounts. 

The in-class assignment this week about Prometheus was new and very interesting to me. I wasn't sure how to save my containers nor was I aware that I'd lose them if I closed a docker terminal so I ran through the assignment several times. I feel I'm getting more comfortable using bash and enjoy the Linux operating system more and more. I got stuck on getting node_exporter working properly, but with the help of an old group member, John, and from the professor, I was able to successfully complete the assignment. I appreciate what our professor is teaching us and how she approaches each assignment. It's been really helpful and I kind of wish we could've started with this format in Fall instead of Spring. Nonetheless, I appreciate everything Professor Hamilton was able to expose us to which makes it easier to digest a lot of what were doing now.
