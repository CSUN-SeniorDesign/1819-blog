Luckily, I was able to get in contact with Neel this week to work on our presentation. Neither of us really know what's going on with the other two guys in our group and our professor said she hasn't seen or heard from them either, but hope everything's ok with them two. Anyways, so we were able to discuss what the future plans are for this next sprint and it turns out we'll be working in our cloud environments soon. I inquired Amazon about rewarding an additional $100 credit to my Educate account and finally received a response from them today. They said that they usually re-up accounts annually from the date the account was created, but they noticed that I'll be graduating before that date comes around. In the email, they mentioned that they can change the graduation date which I believe was a hint that there's other ways of getting me that credit. 

While I wait for confirmation regarding the $100 credit from Amazon, I'll review about EC2 instances, the services and resources we need, and probably play around in my VM a little more just to get more comfortable with the Linux environment. Professor Smith said she'd upload a new task for us to work on as an "in-class" assignment so I've been checking Canvas, but nothing yet. Overall, it was a good week because I was able to get in touch with Neel and touch base on what's to be expected. Plus, I was able to attend gradfest to get all my commencement stuff together so that was cool.
