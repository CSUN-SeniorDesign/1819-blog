This week I started off by trying to get my environment properly setup on AWS for our CLOUD project so I can try to get back on track with my group member, but I still seem to be having some issues with setting up my terraform environment. I keep running into the same errors and I think it has something to do with the formatting of the files. For now, I've focused my attention towards the in-class assignment "Dockerfile". I've never worked with Dockerfile before so this was very interesting to say the least. I didn't know that Dockerfile uses docker images that are part of your docker images repository so that was cool. I'm still trying to get a hang of the syntax and format which was half my battle, but I'm starting to understand it. It doesn't help that my computer is a bit slow, which is really frustrating. Plus, the NIC isn't so good so my connection is a bit shotty everywhere I go. Though it is frustrating not being as proficient as the other students in the class with all this cloud provisioning stuff, I do enjoy going through the motions and hands-on experience I gain from these assignments. I definitely learn a lot by going through the process myself. I'm trying to wrap up the Dockerfile assignment so I can start focusing on the LAMP stack project again.
