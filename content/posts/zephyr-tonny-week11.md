Tonny Wong:

	Communicated with the other group:
		
		- Created Organization called Potato.
		- Have started by purchasing a testing domain.
			- HoneyRoseLove.xyz
		- Setup Route 53 with the domain through namecheap and aws
	
	So far I have setup the organization and have added my current team members which are Shahid  and Daniel.

		- I have encountered issues with aws which was expanding the number of invites to the organization:
		
				- Created a ticket to expand the numbers to 18 since we are going to be working with 2 projects to be safe with the numbers (limit is 20 per organization I believe)
				- Created OU and policies towards the other members to test out giving policies to later to the other groups so that they can only view the progress.
				- Created an account for IAM users to utilize.
				
		- Setup Route 53 for the test domain.
		
	Still communicating with other groups to meet their requirements and provide what they need.
