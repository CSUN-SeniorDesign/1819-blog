# Week 1
Since we have just gotten back from Winter Break we are trying to establish communication with everyone once again. We have to see where the hardware team is and then the Software side, seeing if they made any progress. After the Irrigation side we also have to see what RCrypt wants as requirements for this week seeing if they need any help but they aren't a priority. Once we have the communications set up and have an understanding of everything we can further focus our goals and jobs for the upcoming sprint.

# Tasks as of now
This upcoming sprint I've been tasked with setting up the GitLab repositories and the GitLab CI. This would be my first time actually working with GitLab and the GitLab CI so I need to do some research in how to set it up. If it's anything like Circle CI I think I should be fine as I did take a brief look at Circle CI when working on the Blog from last semester. One of the reasons we decided to go with GitLab CI is the ability to integrate it into AWS without having to use Lambda.

Before doing the GitLab CI I need to setup up the GItlab repositories and transfer all the files from our Github repositories that contain our current foundation and skeleton site. We are going to keep the Github repository so the Dev team can upload files up to that repository and we can move them manually to the Gitlab. This will probably change in the future but we have decided too keep it like this for now.
