So this week not much technical has gone on but many other developments related to the initial phase of this project have kicked off. We had a meeting with another group which I described as group 1 in my last blog post for reference. Just as I expected this meeting was interesting. There was pretty good attendance from all 3 teams involved. A representative from the IS department (a stakeholder) was there as well. He outlined to all teams some technical aspects of the current SAPS which is in production and how it pulls data from databases securely. We will be working with dummy data initially but mimicking the same configuration used in the production system so it can be integrated easily later.

This is one of the many technical questions we had regarding this endeavor. The meeting shed light on some ways that we can put our new found skills from CIT 480 to good use. The Computer Science team seem to be pretty adept and I am interested to see how we will work with them. So far we have had decent communication with the slack channels setup and that will be crucial to maintain throughout. There have been some issues that are outside of the students realm, that have recently been sorted out. A new meeting has been scheduled for next week and this should clarify things a bit. I think this is all to be expected when there are new entrants to a project that has generations of people that have come and gone with limited access to technical documentation or any continuation of much.
