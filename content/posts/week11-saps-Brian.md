# Brian's Blog Week 10 Spring
##Overview this week
This week tended to be a bit slow in terms that I had a bit of too much work load from other places so I was unable to focus as much time as I would like to the project this week. Pretty much im in the midst of wrapping up the documentation for the rds module. I as well need to consult with Erik on what metrics we want to setup for our grafana dashboard I have some ideas so far but I want to double check with him to make sure apart from that some of my future plans is to sort of move away from RDS. I want to setup other features perhaps try and see if I can work with Jenkins or Kubernetes even if it the cluster or the pipeline is not up for long I still want to gain some experience and familiarity with it. At some point as well I want to check in with the Computer Science group they saud that they had code for us or part of it so I want to see if we can get our hands on that so that we can implement it to our infrastructure.
