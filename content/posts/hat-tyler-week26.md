### What's new this week?
This week, we started planning for our new lightweight infrastructure. For our new infrastructure, we will be using Lightsail. This week, I created our design document, milestones, and basic network diagram. I also created a new GitLab repository, and integrated that repository with our Slack channel as well. Next week, we will start working on creating our new infrastructure.

This week was used to get everyone on the same page for the plan for our new infrastructure, and creating an initial design document and network diagram. The other members of my group spent this week finishing up tasks on our previous infrastructure. As of now, we have a high-level plan for our new infrastructure, and plan to get more granular as we discuss each service we will be using individually.

I created 10 milestones on our GitLab for various parts of our infrastructure. I also created around a 3 page design document. This breaks down into:
* An overview section, which specifies the services we will be using.
* A context section, which specifies why we are creating the infrastructure.
* An existing solution section, which describes our current infrastructure, and how it is not sufficient for our plans.
* A goals section, which explains our primary goals for this new infrastructure.
* A non-goals section, which explains elements of our infrastructure which aren't a current priority (for example, 100% uptime).
* A milestones section, which states milestones we will achieve throughout the creation and implementation of our infrastructure.
* A service breakdown section, which breaks down each service and states what we will use it for.
* A resources and credits section, which states the resources we will use during the creation of our infrastructure. This list will be updated as our infrastructure progresses.


#### Future plans
We plan to work on this infrastructure until it is complete. I heard a rumor that there will be a final project for the class (which will take multiple sprints to complete), so we may not finish the infrastructure completely if that is the case.
