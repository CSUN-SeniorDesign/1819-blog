This week I mainly worked on trying to get my terraform setup completely and properly. Last week I was having some trouble when running terraform plan, but I think I got it to work properly. Now I'm having issues with terraform init and I think it's because something's wrong on my AWS side. I plan on looking into it more this weekend. As the semester comes to a close, it seems like all of the papers, quizzes, and tests are starting to take a toll on me. I saw a member of my group last night in a different class, but we weren't able to talk because we were in the middle of a quiz. One thing I did learn last week was how to properly setup a dockerfile to host my php website. That was really interesting and I enjoyed working on that assignment.
