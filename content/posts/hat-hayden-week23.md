This week was fairly slow. There is still more work to be done on the Datadog monitoring but another teammate has volunteered to handle it. At this point the only thing for me to really do is to catch up with the rest of the team, as I have fallen behind in my understanding of the current system. To do this I have begun reading through documentation written by my teammates, as well as official documentation from AWS. Unfortunately, due to not having a direct assignment from my group and a number of classes having projects before the coming Spring Recess, I did not accomplish much more than this this week. During Spring Recess I will be consulting with my teammates to make sure that I am ready to present after the break is over, as well as accomplish whatever task they come up for me during this time.
