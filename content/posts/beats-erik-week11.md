# Week 11
Our SAPS team consist of mostly old BEATS members (Me, Alex, Brian) plus the addition of Shahed from matabit. We have spent this week settings up the AWS organization, Slack channels, and linking up with other SAPS teams (IS & CS) in attempts trying to understand what is that they needed from us. Things are still pretty unclear regarding the SAPS project and our communication with other teams, but we hope it will be solved early next week. Attending the SAPS meetings with the other teams have been difficult for most of us since it either crash with work, other classes or the meetings occur at times outside our school schedule. It has been said that we get one warning if we miss one meeting and we will be kicked out if we miss two.

I hope that we can find a balance in our team and with the other teams so that we can get started on this project and gain some real hands-on experience with team-work and infrastructure.
