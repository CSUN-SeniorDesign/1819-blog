This week started off with a team discussion and assigning tasks & duties which was extremely helpful. I was asked to look into the issue with the Elastic Load Balancer and trying to get it to work, which was unsuccessful on my part. I was having issues getting terraform to work properly on my machine and had to do some research on how to fix it. Then  I had to install AWS CLI on my local machine which wasn't bad at all. I've been pretty swamped this week with other issues so I haven't been able to focus too much on getting everything to run properly on my AWS account, but I plan on working on this tonight going into the weekend. I'm hoping to be able to get everything up and running on my own account several times to get comfortable enough to run the demonstration for the presentation this upcoming Monday.

As stated previously, I need to focus on getting the ELB working properly and find out how to get port 443 configured properly with SSL. I've got a lot on my plate, but I've been able to get most of my work for other classes out of the way so I'll be able to focus most of my attention to this project.
