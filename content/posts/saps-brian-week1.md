# Week 1 Brian's Blog

### This Week
This week was a bit slow in that it was used more as a catching up week. The good thing about this week though is that we all got together and touched based on what has been done. So far we were able to convert our VPC code from the way we had it to modules which is much more efficient. Shahed was able to finish this task before winter break. What we ended up doing this week was just making sure that our documentation had been finished and we ended up editing a few of the documents while adding a couple more. We have as well started assigning tasks and me and Erik will be working on the lambda part of our infrastructure.

### Next week plans

By next week we will start on our sprint and are eager to keep building on what we already have.
