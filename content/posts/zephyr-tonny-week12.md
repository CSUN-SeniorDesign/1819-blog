Tonny Wong:

	Communicated with the other group:
		
		- Created Organization Unit and add CS Teams.
		- Have helped purchase 2 domains for the 2 teams.
		- Added policies for view only for CS Teams.
		- Calculated certain cost for appliances and decide which applications to use as third party.
	
	Added Organization Unit For the following CS Teams:
		- RCrypt Project
		- Irrigation Project

	Once my Organization has expanded I have started to add the Organization Units and add new policies for these:
		
	Currently working on calculations for cost of the project but still have few issues with more in depth needs:
	
		- In the Irrigation project a Relation Database is wanted, in AWS it comes up to $600 dollars monthly due to being on demand which we found our that using another method like mysql would be more convinient.
		
		- For RCrypt there will be two side of the use of Buckets and Instances. (They would want to provide services for small businesses and companies)
			- They will both vary in prices due to self hosting on companies and businesses will be hosted for them)
				
		- Both require EC2 Instances and S3 Buckets which we know EC2 Instances will be at certain point expensive if the EC2 runs 24/7 so we have to figure out how to run it or when to do so.
		
	Communication will be occuring with the teams so that requirements are met.
