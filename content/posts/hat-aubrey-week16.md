"New Year - New Direction"

The start of the semester is interesting. At the first day, our group has been told that the direction of our project is changing. AWS will not be used. Siteground will instead be used. As a group we are leaning towards finishing our "obligations" with the existing project and move on to a new one. 

As I am looking around for a new project to embark on, I saw a NodeJS based microservice application. It looks like it will be perfect to practice our DevOps skill. I am going to try to build the application manually over the weekend to make sure that it is working. If it does work, we can use this code to practice:
- docker-compose
- ECS
- CI/CD
- staging and production lifecycle of the application
- networking on docker to make the different microservices to communicate with each other
- Auto Scaling group and other AWS services
