<h3> Neel Patel: </h3>

	Assigned duties for this week:
	
			- Learn IPtables
			- understand each rules and chains in the IPtables rules in the firewallA and FirewallB.
				
			
		Learning and understanding IPtables:
			- For this week my group in Advanced tech group was tasked to look at the IPtables in 
			  FirewallA and FirewallB so that when we move the firewall rules to the new two firewall
			  recently added we have a better understanding of the firewall rules and how they are working.
			  At the beginning of the week we were just looking at the IPtables from the firewall themselves 
			  but when we didn't understand some rules and chains we asked the professor who gave us a grate lid
			  to use FWbuilder which was used to create this rules. FWbuilder has a graphical user interface that 
			  can be used to create firewall rules and when the rules are configured how we want the builder will
			  automatically put firewall rules into each firewall that we configure. At first when i found this out 
			  i downloaded windows version and started using it and understanding it so i can understand all the rules
			  but i was not using the correct files rules.v4 and rules.v6, which was pulled by one of my group mate and uploaded to 
			  Gitlab,to load into FWbuilder which gave me hard time. On Thursday, We had added
			  chance to talk to professor Wiggly who pointed out that the correct file for the FWbuilder was ATechLab.fwb. 
			  So currently i am in the process of learning FWbuilder and usin the correct file so that whatever i learned i 
			  can saw it my group and then move to my next project which is setting up LAMP server with three group members but still
			  contribute to Advanced Tech Lab to help them progress on the IPtables which was going hard of us.
