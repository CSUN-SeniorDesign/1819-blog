	- Final Project:

		- Decided with the Kuberneties Project
		
	- Done:
	
		- Created github repository which is public and forked
			- Forking the repository secures that the master github repository does not get affected with our changes and will be our finalizer so that everything that is correct 
			and secure to submit will be submited there.
		- Our group meeting will be held in Monday 4/29 to discuss further action of what will we be doing for this project
