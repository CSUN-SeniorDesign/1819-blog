	- For this week first i had to research how to fix my lambda functions to stop and start 
	my instances. Last week, i had set up my functions but for some reason it did not work and i
	got alerts in my email that my free micro t2 was used 85% and only 15% was left in my free tier
	before it start to charge me. Since my last semester i lost my AWS account so i had to create using my personal
	one and that only got 720 hours of free micro t2 usage. Also i had to research how to delete my default
	apache page so that my information do not show up whenever someone goes to my zephyr90.com website.
	Also i began to add installing Prometheus to my already created Ansible script so that everything is 
	installed at same time and the service is brought up when the server comes up or reboots. After that i have not 
	been able to do anything since i had few exams so i had study and since it is my last semester and i do not want
	to fail my classes.
