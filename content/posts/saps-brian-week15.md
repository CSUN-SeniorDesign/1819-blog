# Brian's Blog week 14 Spring
## EKS setup & Playbooks
So far I have installed the kubernetes tools needed as well as have started with using amazon eks which I will end up using as one of my tools for the final project. I have started setting up an ansible playbook that will end up deploying the master and a couple of worker nodes. Currently I have been able to test out one of the playbooks but still have to try out the workers see if there are any issues there.
## Future Plans
I want to setup some autoscaling policies and cloudwatch metrics at first i am going to do evertyhing or as much as possible through the console after all that is over I will automate as much as I can with periodic updates to see where things end up at.
