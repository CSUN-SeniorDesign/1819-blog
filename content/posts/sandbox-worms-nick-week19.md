I finished documenting the physical components of all of the equipment that's currently installed in the MDF. This was the last leg of the documentation I was responsible for as a group member of the Sandbox Worms because I'll be switching over to a different group to work on more AWS related material. I was able to get the documentation wrapped up by Tuesday and sent it out to the team for review. I uploaded all of the movies and pictures to a Google Drive shared folder and sent invites to some of the members of the Sandbox Worms. The upload itself took a little over two and half hours because of the size of some of the videos. I advised the Sandbox Worms group to notify me of any necessary changes or concerns regarding the document and since I haven't heard back for several days, I'm guessing everything's ok. 

Now I'm starting a new chapter by joining a different group with Neel, Yerden, and Vilard to work on things that we learned with Instructor Hamilton last semester. The preliminary goal for this sprint is to get a LAMP stack running successfully within our own virtual environments. Once we have it working properly, the plan is to implement Terraform to automate the process and use Ansible playbooks to configure all the required software. It's been a few months since I last looked at anything related to AWS web services so I'm expecting a bit of a challenge. I've also taken upon the task of pursuing the AWS Cloud Architect cert so I definitely have my work cut out for me. On top of all of this, I have four other classes to worry about so GOOD LUCK TO ME - YAY!
