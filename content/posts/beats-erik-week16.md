# CIT 481 - SAPS
#### Week 1
First week back from the break has been slow so we have focused on cleaning up our current code and documentation to make it easier for us to move forward. Our leader Shahed has done a great job organizing, planning and coming up with ideas. He noticed that Fargate has become cheaper over the break which may be a more suitable option for us. He also told us about Prometheus and how we can use it for our monitoring system which to me, sounds way easier than Datadog that we worked with last semester.

#### Sprint 1
We have a much more organized plan this time moving forward. I will be working on the Lambda part which I am excited about because I have little to no experience with it, since it was never my task in previous projects.
