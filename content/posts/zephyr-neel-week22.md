<h3> Neel Patel: </h3>

	Assigned duties for this week:
	
			
			- Install LAMP server with Laravel using Ansible script.
				
			
			-For this week of the LAMP stack project i continued to work on my Ansible Script so that i can
			finish setting up the LAMP with Laravel. As of last week a had already set up so that i install
			Apache, Mysql-client, PHP and composer, but i had difficult time installing all the modules require 
			for the Laravel. At first last week i was installing them using shell commands but i kept getting errors
			saying to use apt instead of apt-get install commands so i had to do some research of how to install
			all the modules. Since on Wednesday we had a project that dealt with LAMP stack and composer i was finally 
			able to get the correct format of installing the php modules. After that i began to create a new project using
			the composer for Laravel, and to test this i ran the Ansible script on my second Virtual machine which at first 
			gave me few errors and later was able to six it and it ran successful and i will be running this script on Monday 
			during my presentation as proof. Also this past two weeks i had difficult time communicating with my group which i
			am at fault as well, but currently we have four members and beside me i have not seen any of my group during class.
			Currently i am able to show up to class on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, but other group members are only able to
			show up on Monday and Wednesday which sometimes give me and them less time to discuss project progression. I am able to get
			my things done while others have not contributed as much which is fine since i am able to do more and learn more. I just hope that
			staring next sprint we have more members showing up to class since i need their AWS account to do the terraform since my account 
			has been suspended or otherwise i will create another account with my personal email so that can start to test my Ansible script 
			on remote server and do the terraform to finish the requirements that the professor has given us.
