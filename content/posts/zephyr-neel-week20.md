<h3> Neel Patel: </h3>

	Assigned duties for this week:
	
			
			- Install LAMP server manually in a virtual machine to later transfer into an ansible script.
				
			

			-For this week of the LAMP stack project my task was to set up a Manuel installation on Amazon Web service as test. 
			This Manuel installation was meant so that I can understand all the commands I needed to successfully install PHP 7.0, 
			MySql-client, Apache, and Laravel on a Ubuntu machine.Also later using these I would create a Ansible script which would 
			run and install all of these in matter of seconds and where I would not need to type all the commands manually. 
			I have previously worked with LAMP stack in my CIT class to set up Wordpress with LAMP stack, but 
			I have never worked with Laravel before which is a good thing since I get to learn something new. 
			Also as I mention in my last blog post that I have never worked with Ansible which is bit hard for me at the current moment 
			since the test where I was learning to install all of these requirements was AWS and because of reason unknown to me 
			my account got suspended at the beginning of these week. So at the start of the week I begin calling AWS to retrieve my account but was unsuccessful. 
			Then I started working on a local virtual machine where I had to install everything again which was bit easier since I was documenting my progress
			when I was working on AWS since my teammates wanted to learn how to set the LAMP stack themselves. 
			So starting Wednesday I began to create a Ubuntu virtual machine and begin to install the LAMP stack requirements again and have 
			gotten as far as Installing all the required packages for Laravel and the test is good so far. After that today I begin transferring 
			commands I used to an Ansible script which should be done over the weekend for the presentation on Monday and then will have professor 
			to check that the installation is good and move on to using the Ansible script on our aws instances which my teammates has set up.
