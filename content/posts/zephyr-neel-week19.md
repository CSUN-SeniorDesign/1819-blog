<h3> Neel Patel: </h3>

	Assigned duties for this week:
	
			- Divide work between team members
			- Install LAMP server manually in a virtual machine to later transfer into an ansible script.
				
			

			- For this week I was setting up LAMP server manually in a virtual environment first
			and later transfer into an ansible playbook. For the LAMP stack we needed to install
			mysql-cli which is not installing whole database but just enough packages for the LAMP 
			stack to work. For the PHP i install PHP 7 and install laravel 5.5 or higher. i have install 
			LAMP stack before with wordpress, but its my first time working with laravel so i had to do 
			a lot of researched and figure out how things work which i am still in process of learning right now.
			With laravel we have to install apache and PHP modules for it to work with LAMP stack.
			After i have everthing installed manually and will ask professor to check to make sure that it is good 
			for what we need and then transfer those commands into a ansible playbook. Last semester we had projects 
			where we had to use ansible playbook, but i was not incharge of that so i need to learn how playbook work and
			try first locally and then try on remote AWS linux server to see the sucess.
