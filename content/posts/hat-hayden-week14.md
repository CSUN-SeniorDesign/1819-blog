This week, I unfortunately did not accomplish much personally. I attempted to contact the CS team but was largely unsuccessful. Though another teammate was better able to contact them, we still did not receive important details such as the client's email which is beginning to hinder our work. Due to the dwindling number of tasks that need to be performed and the proactiveness of my teammates, there was not much for me to do this week. However, I was tasked with learning Lambda and Docker in order to be able to help more next week, which I began looking into. I am currently researching the subjects based on documentations written before hand by my teammates in order to catch up and help out for the final stretch.
