Our team's presentation was this past Monday and I couldn't make it because my youngest kid came down with a flu and couldn't make it to daycare. I couldn't find anyone to look after him at the spare of the moment so I stayed home to look after him. It has still been a challenge getting everyone to meet together at the same time, whether it be in person or online. I'm not quite sure what the next leg of this project entails nor am I able to get in contact with other members of the team to discuss. This week I found the in-class assignment to be extremely beneficial. I had no idea how to setup a second virtual host using the same virtual machine so this was all new to me. Started off using the same VM that used to create the LAMP stack from last week's in-class assignment. The HTML part was pretty easy, but copying the index.html file and moving it to another location, copying the 000-default.config file and configuring it to point to a second webserver (site2.dev) was foreign to me. Also, adjusting the "pages available" file was something I never even knew existed. Making note of the correct IP address so I can point it to the new webserver, creating an alias for the webpage, all of that was very good stuff that I definitely appreciate and would like to get more proficient with. 

As for our cloud project, I'd definitely like to get everyone on the same page so we all have an idea of what direction we're headed. It's been extremely difficult getting the team together and the scheduling conflicts we're all experiencing momentarily is making things even harder. The plan for this week is to at least get together in class to discuss challenges, tasks, and plans on what to expect for the next few legs of this project.
