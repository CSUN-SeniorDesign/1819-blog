# Kick-Off Meeting and Problems with CSUN SAPS

This week we officially started our Senior Design projects. We started off Monday by setting up our AWS organization and making sure that the team members have a way to collaborate.

Later that day at 5pm, we had the kick-off meeting with the Computer Science Senior Design group, Dr Liu, and a group of students from the Inofrmation Systems department. The meetings purpose was to get familiar with each other and the project and to exchange thoughts and to gain a basic understanding of the current system in place and how things could potentially develop.

We got a set of resources and were invited into the official CSUN SAPS slack channel.

Nothing technical has been done as of now, since we don't have any access to either the Git repository or any AWS infrastructure to gain an understanding of the underlying architecture of the application.

One of the things that we plan on doing is to containerize a basic .NET application, but we haven't gotten to that yet due to the discussions and meetings that we've been having with the computer science department.

And that is currently where our problem lies. We have been given a "Performance Contract" to sign, which was not initially agreed upon and certain things are expected from us that were not previously discussed in this project.

Currently, we are waiting on Professor Wiegley to renegotiate the terms under which we will resume this project.
