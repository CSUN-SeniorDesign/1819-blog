# Week 18
Working on setting up and finishing the Gitlab CI. We had a change of location for it to be installed. I needed to setup the Gitlab in the local instance that we have created for the website. I'm working on getting that done last but first I'm trying to finish up the Gitlab CI part by finishing the yaml file it needs for the continuous integration. THe website is based on Laravel so the yaml file that is being implemented will build it and see if everything works. Before I was trying to do it through docker but since I haven't been able to get that to work I'm going to try it a different way and just work straight with the files for the site.

# Tasks as of now
I must get this Gitlab CI done before next week so I'll be working on it over the weekend in hope I get it done by presentation day. Afterwards our group will work on the next step which for me is monitoring. We have decided to use datadog for our monitoring solution which I have some experience with. I will be setting up Datadog on the instance we have on AWS and I'll discuss what we want to monitor with it up and running.
