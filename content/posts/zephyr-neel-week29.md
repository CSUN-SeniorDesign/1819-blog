	- For this week of the project we started working on our final project given by the professor.
	We had a chose between three different projects to do. Since we are a team of three we each decided
	what we wanted to and two out of three chose Kubernets Cluster with Spot Instances on aws. Since this
	is a totally different than what we have done before we began this week by researching about the topic.
	I was little bit confuse about the topic as i was researching and could not get it to figured out. On thyrsday
	professor actually explained what we needed to do and i found a step by step guide created by AWS themselves 
	on creating Kubernets Cluseter with spot instances. Based on my researching earlier this week i know that compare
	to on-demand EC2 instances the spot instances cost is really cheap and because of that it really affordable when we 
	want to run a lot of servers. Also kubernets have a Auto scaling so that if their is alot of traffic it will
	bring up another spot instance. But the bad thing about Spot instances is that they could be terminated at any time
	by AWS. The reason i found was that AWS has a certain numbers of Spot instances allowed in each reagion and if there
	are to many in one reagoin then they start terminating them and we wont have control over that.Since now i have the 
	step by step guide i will be working on this during the weekend since i had some problems with my graduation stuff and 
	i needed to take of that first along with quizes and projects for other classes. Also for the last group project i have to
	upload all the files to where the final project Repo is so that we have both in place and all three member have access to it.
	This Final project seems fun and will be really helpfull in future.
