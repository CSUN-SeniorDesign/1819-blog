I've been compiling a list of all the physical specs of the two racks that we're working on in the MDF. I was in there for a couple of hours last Thursday and Friday, and spent a couple more hours in there yesterday to brush up on some loose ends. For the most part, a majority of the blade servers are HP ProLiant BL460c and consist of two 146GB SAS hard drives each. I've also been able to list the IP addresses that associate to specific blades. I've been receiving information from group members regarding any information they feel should be added to the document I've created. So far I've received info regarding 

It feels like we've been able to get some good work done in this two week sprint compared to anything we've done in the past semester. We've been able to get an inventory list going, installed an OS on the two new firewalls and mounted them in the MDF, got information regarding some of the hardware components inside the machines, and received some direction from Professor Wiegley.

After this sprint, I'll be working with a couple fellow group members and one additional class member on a new project that incorporates the material we learned from Instructor Hamilton last semester. It'll deal with using more of AWS web services and resources, terraform for automating, ansible to configure playbooks, and CircleCI for faster deployment. Our new instructor informed us that we'll be using a lot more metrics to monitor our systems, particularly Prometheus. I'm excited to start on this new project because I'd like to get more familiar with cloud services and being able to successfully spin up instances.
