# Week 15

This week we continue to closely look into whatever the Irrigation Dev team needs and implement it into the foundation we are creating for them. This week was relatively slower which allowed us to assist the RCrypt team with what they needed. Since they also don't have much of requirements we had just asked what they might need from us as of now. The latest update required a Dockerfile that was able to run Git and Java. My task was to setup this Dockerfile. Then we are starting to look into setting up security for the Irrigation group. We have a site up for them but it doesn't have any certificates.

# Tasks as of Now

Setting up the Dockerfile was my task, for the Rcrypt team as well as look into setting up security wherever I could. The Dockerfile is in progress, looking into how to set up a Java environment for Java to run in as well as a Git. This shouldn't be that difficult just had to setup a multistage Dockerfile that had base images capable of running Java. I'm still messing around with it but that's the basic idea that I came up with.
