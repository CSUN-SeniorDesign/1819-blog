This weekâ€™s Lab assignment was a bit challenging and took most of my available time. I like the way these labs are structured so we can practice using different skills. Using buil-on assignments is the best way to learn material in my opinion, however sometimes can get you stuck and frustrated. 
This time I went for nginx instead of apache to see any difference, configuration is similar. Had issues with Dockerfile syntax, still trying to resolve.
