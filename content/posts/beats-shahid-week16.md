## Shahid's Blog. Week 16
#### What's new this week?

## During winter break
During winter break, I learned about three new pieces of software that could be highly useful to the work that we are doing in CIT 480/481: YouTrack, Selenium Webdriver, Jenkins, and GitLab. I was able to learn about many new things since I was working closely with a family friend that is part of the industry. He taught me about agile workflow, project management, and using different software. During this time I also realized the need for owning the services that you use because of several data breaches on big name companies.  

## YouTrack
YouTrack is a suite of project management software such as Kanban and Agile Boards with the ability to generate reports that are displayed on a clean dashboard. The main reason I wanted my team to start using this software is for the issue tracking. Throughout CIT 480, we used GitHub to handle issues but we found it was lacking in features that would make issue tracking worthwhile. In YouTrack, we have the ability to provide not only a title for the issue but a summary, description, a set of tags to easily find the issue, and priority among many more settings and features.     

## Selenium WebDriver
Since the software-irrigation group is making a website for us to host, I thought it would be a great idea if we could also handle debugging and asserting for their website. We would make a framework where we would test to see if their website is working properly. For example, going to the website URL will return the expected page title, then go to the login page via clicking on the login link. Again we would assert that the expected login page title is equal to the actual login page title and see if all the UI works properly on the website. Because of the push for the "Shift Left" methodology where the industry is pushing developers rather than quality assurance testers towards using debugging frameworks, it's important for DevOPS to be able to do the same.

## Jenkins and GitLab
Jenkins has the ability to hook onto GitLab in order to automatically do certain tasks outlined in the settings. This lead to the idea that we should not only own the issue tracking service, but also the repository that we push our work to. Not only would we get experience in setting it up and maintaining it but since we are doing this project for the school, it would be fairly easy to maintain since we have our own servers here.
