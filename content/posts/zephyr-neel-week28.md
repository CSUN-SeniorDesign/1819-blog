    - For this week i just waorked on finishing up the rest of the project that the professor assigned.
	For the LAMP Stack project the two things we needed to do is write an Ansible script to install prometusus on
	to the two Linux server that is hosting our Laravel project. The script needes to be run from the NAT/Bastion
	host like we did to install Apache2, Mysql-client, PHP, Composoer, and Laravel. Since we did the assignment
	alredy in class about installing the prometusus on to a linux server it was bit easy to do and since we are not
	using docker like the assignment we had to make sure that the prometusus and Node exporter services stay on even when 
	server reboots from the Lambda function everyday so that we can check the status and health of the instances and see
	if anything is wrong with them. Another task we had to do was create a RDS using AWS and terraform. Since i do not have
	experience with this i left it as a last taks,but since the finals are coming and i have a lot of homework i decided that 
	i will work on it on the weekends and hopefully finish before the next week starts. Since we have to choose another finals
	project we have to be done with this as soon as possible and i have to study for finals and turn in Final Essays.
