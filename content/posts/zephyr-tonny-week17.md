Tonny Wong:

Week 2:

This week I have worked on documentation and improving it for understanding purposes. Terraform files can be complicated when it comes
to running it and one can get lost. The documentation that are created are for setting up things for AWS.
	- ALB
	- EC2
	- S3 Bucket
	- VPC
	- Terraform and AWS
This week also I have done research into using modules for terraform and plan to use modules for my files.
Next week we will start using AWS instances to start testing the CS team's code to verify if it works on a online environment and improve efficiency.
