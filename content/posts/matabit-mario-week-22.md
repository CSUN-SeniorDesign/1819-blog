# Week 22

Unfortunately this week I was unable to do much due to being sick which made me miss three out of the four days we meet together. However, I was informed by the team of issues that they have come across. One issue was the resolve.conf file on the new servers. It was preventing them from resolving domain names. For example, you cant ping google.com but you can ping it by its IP address. The second issue was complications when accessing ILO on the old firewalls, the only time we were able to access the ILO on the old firewalls is when we were physically connected to them in the MDF. The ILO setups between the old firewalls and the new firewalls were different, as we didn't setup the ILO on the old firewalls and we are not sure how they were setup.
