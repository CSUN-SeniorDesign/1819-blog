# Week 16
For the first week of class we got back together as the Advancing Tech group to discuss where we are at and what needs to be accomplished over the remainder of the semester. Most of last semester involved figuring out the current configurations set by Professor Wiegley and setting up virtual machines in VirtualBox to recreate the infrastructure and configurations for practice in a safe environment. Right now we are working on determining how we plan to split our group into subgroups and how we will devide the remaining tasks between us. We are waiting for more guidance as to which tasks need to be accomplished first before we can begin splitting up the tasks and start tackling them. Other than that, the rest of Advancing Tech Team 1 and I gave a short presentation outlining what we have been able to accomplish thus far during the fall semester.
