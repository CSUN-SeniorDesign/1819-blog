Upcoming holiday left us only three days of meeting as a group and giving us less time on discussing or further steps, issues and approach to those issues. This week’s main goal was focusing on functioning secondary DHCP server that can still provide services when the primary goes down. I have been looking through the failover.config files which will get into action whenever connection with main server is failed or if it is down. 
Another important thing that have been discussed this week is mapping of our network. By running ifconfig command we determined main machines of the network and their ip addresses. As I mentioned above the holiday really affected on our group’s workflow, however I think it is important for us to have a little break before the last week of classes, when most of the group projects are due. Happy holidays!
