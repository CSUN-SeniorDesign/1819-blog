Overview:
- Research into Cloudflare and basic setup

What I did:
- Extenuating circumstances restricted me from giving the project my full attention this week, but I managed to look more into Cloudflare and how to set it up
- Created a Cloudflare account
- We decided to use Aubrey's domain legalforms.info
- Became a manager on Aubrey's domain on Namecheap
- Changed the DNS namerservers to Cloudflare's
- Currently waiting for the registrars to resolve before conitnuing

Issues:
- DNS registrars take a long time to resolve (a few hours at least, up to two whole days)

Next Time:
- Continue to setup Cloudflare over the weekend
- Look into potentially utilizing Terraform
- If the final project is assigned next week, I will have to refocus my efforts to that.
