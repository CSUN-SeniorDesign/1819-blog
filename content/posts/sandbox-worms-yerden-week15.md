This week we finally had some hands-on experience with servers that we are going to use. As professor Wiegley provided us with two new hp servers we started testing out and practicing installing OS (Ubuntu 18.10 LTS) on those servers as well as configuring them. Thanks to Mark this activity was very informative, since he has over 30 yearsâ€™ experience working with servers. So, he explained why in our case with 3 drives the best option will be Mirror 2 drives and use 3 one as spare which will replace any drive in case of failure. We also looked at different RAID configurations and ILO interface. 
Also, we had a little field trip to MDF which was pretty exciting, Mark showed us around and then we did network checking of the interfaces which was successful. 
Looking forward to start working with these machines next semester!
