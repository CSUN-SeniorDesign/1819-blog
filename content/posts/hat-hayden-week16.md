Being that this was the first week back from back, most of the time spent this week was spent catching up with one another and reassessing where we stood. Over the break, our client made a significant change to what she originally wanted from our group, proposing that we use SiteGround as opposed to AWS. Because SiteGround is a web hosting site in and of itself, it effectively cuts out all of our work we have done so far, and leaves us with nothing to do or work on. As such, we had no choice but to wait for further instructions from the professor before getting anything truly started.

In the meantime, during a rerun of our final presentation from the previous semester, the professor suggested we work on modularizing our Terraform code for our AWS server. With nothing else to be done, I will be looking into this over the weekend in order to understand how to do so. Even if we do not use our current code in the future, the practice and knowledge of modularization will surely prove useful.
