## Week 15 - Final Fall Semester Update
It is now week 15 and we will be bringing the semester to a close. We have achieved most of our goals that we set out for this half of our senior project. We have a robust infrastructure planned, documented and implemented. We have been integrating with both of the other SAPS teams well. The CS team has changed the specific technologies the SAPS will be using. They have chosen to change to:

- React.js for Front-end
- Express.js for Web-Server
- Node.js for Server Runtime
- MySQL for Database

They switched from .NET Core which was a welcome change by all parties. One thing it does is allow us to get rid of a Windows instance that was required before to use .NET. We are still waiting for dummy data to use with an API. In the meantime there is still some technical task we have to complete:

- Containerize DB and application
- Create a Dockerfile for node.js application
- Create an SSL certificate for the SAPS domain
- Create documentation for all of the above

So this is where the project stands as of now. The last few weeks were really kind of more administrative than technical, with the exception of the last 3 weeks in which we actually got to create infrastructure.
