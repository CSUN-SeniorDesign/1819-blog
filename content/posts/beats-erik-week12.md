### Project
This week has been more exciting than the first ones because we finally started to work on things. The source code was finally sent to us but it did not have much documentation, so we are still a little bit lost on that part. One of our tasks will be to create a documentation that explains steps in detail how and why we did things so that people working on it in the future can understand and pick up from where we left it. It was decided that we should use docker to containerize instances and that we should have something up and running pretty soon so the CS team have something to work with. I was not assigned to the docker task in earlier projects, so I have some catching up to do. It was also decided that we have a monthly budget on $400 which should be more than enough for us. The AWS infrastructure currently runs on one single micro instance with without a load balancer to balance the traffic during peak hours. We will also use DataDog to collect metrics from our instances so that we can detect problems easier.

### New tools
Leo told us about an amazing website that I never heard about that is called CloudCraft (https://cloudcraft.co/) which allows you to visualize your AWS infrastructure with diagrams. GitLab (https://gitlab.com/) is another tool that was introduced to me this week, it is similar to GitHub but it allows us to work on our repositories as a team and have the repo private at the same time.
