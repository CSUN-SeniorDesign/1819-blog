# Week 1

Back from winter break week 1 has been a little slow so the team and I met up and talked about where we left off at last semester with our project. 

We also discussed with the professor about how the teams and tasks are going to be split up this semester compared to last semester. 

Another thing we looked over was the Advancing Tech Team assignment sheet that unfortunately most of us did not know about because it wasn't really mentioned last semester and gave us an insight on exactly what we need to do for the project step by step. This is very helpful for us because last semester we had to wait on the professor to tell us what he wants and it was hard to get in contact with at times. 



### What's Next? 

As of now we are waiting on professor smith to get back to us about how the teams are going to be split and what are the tasks we need to work on. 

One thing we need to get done next week is to install and configure the two new servers we received in order to start working on them.
