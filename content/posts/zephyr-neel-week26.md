<h3> Neel Patel: </h3>

	Assigned duties for this week:

		- For this week of the project i was tasked to work on my Lambda script so that i can shutdown my EC2 instance 
		everyday as professor described in her requirements. Since i did not know anything about Lambda i asked my classmates
		to help me. Last semester we had project that had Lambda in a project requirement but we did not get it figured out so it is
		new to me and i learned a new skill that will help me in this project and also in future projects i want to do at work. 
		As of last week i was able to get 2000 credits in aws since i work for a non profit and mu boss wanted to learn aws and probably take
		the certification. Also another task that i worked on was to figured out how i can secure my private Ec2 Linux instances since when i got to
		Zephyr90.com it display the default Apache web page and thats something that is not secured and should be kept hidden so that no one can see that page 
		since they can use that information to probably hack my Instances and that would charge me extra on AWS. Also this week i began to do research on how
		to add AWS SSL certification to my Elastic Load Balancer so that any communication from a user to my website is secure but from Elastic Load Blancer to my Private
		Instances only uses port 80 instead of port 443. Since i am new to the SSL i began by requesting a SSL from AWS certification manager on my domain *.Zephyr90.com 
		using DNS as confirmation. To make sure it works i needed to add a CNAME on my Route53 and i waited for 30 minutes to finish confirmation and now i am in progress on 
		adding that SSL into my Elastic Load Balancer.
