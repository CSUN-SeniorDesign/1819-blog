This week we continued working on 2 new servers. Last semester we installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, however trying to solve the issue with the Ethernet port, we decided to replace old motherboard with new one and upgrade for 18.10 LTS. 
Replacing motherboard was a nice experience, thankfully we have an experienced specialist in the team so there was no struggle except some minor delays that was caused by looking for the right inventory (thermal paste, cables, etc.). After replacing the motherboard, we installed new OS and configured RAID 1 (mirroring, since we have 3 drives and one will be left as spare). Also, we looked into ILO interface and configured the login credentials. After new servers got ready to go, we headed to the MDF where we mounted them into the racks and tested ports for connection.
