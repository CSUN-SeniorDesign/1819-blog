# Communication and Application #

----------

I spent most of the time this week communicating with the developers. We talked about the advantages of different sql servers. We spoke at great length of what AWS can provide to them. They initially wanted to use MongoDB. We wanted them to be aware that even though MongoDB itself is free, hosting it is not free. There is still cost associated in using MongoDB. The costs include hosting, maintenance, patching and others. So, to make a fair comparison of MongoDB and DynamoDB, proper costs allocation and determination is essential. The developers have decided to use MySQL for now because they are more familiar with using SQL syntax. 

In our AWS infrastructure, I have set up our ECS. I have setup the cluster, ecs instances, auto-scaling group for the ECS instances and launch configuration. Because all three of us came from different groups, we each had our own convention on how to structure the terraform codes and folders. We spent some time deciding on how we will handle this.
