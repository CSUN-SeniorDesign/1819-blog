# Week 17
Continued to work on the GitLab setup and the Gitlab CI implementation. I encountered some problems with trying to integrate it into AWS but that may because I'm just not experienced with setting up a pipeline. I should be able to finish setting this up during the weekend after I discuss and get some help from my group members. Afterwards we will begin setting up the presentation for Monday and working on the demo we will be showing.

# Tasks as of Now
Like we were trying to do the previous semester we will be trying to keep up to date with the groups we are working with. Since there seems to be an issue with the irrigation group we might be stalled for quite some time which at that point we will have to talk to the professor and see what we can do about it. We are also working with the RCrypt and as of now they aren't needing our assistance since most of what they are doing is just using local resources. We will probably talk to them sometime next week and see if they need anything on AWS which they have implied they do from a talk from last week.
