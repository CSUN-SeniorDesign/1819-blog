This week after presentations and lecture we had to chose a final project for the last 2 weeks sprint, after a quick vote we chose Kubernetes Cluster. Nick created a git repo for the project, and since this technology is new for all of us we decided to start off from researching on it. 
Kubernetes or EKS is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. We will set up and deploy the cluster on AWS Spot instances which basically are space EC2 capacity for discounted price. It's price is determined by term trends in supply and demand and the amount of On-Demand capacity on a particular instance, availability zone or region. 
Along with EKS, Auto Scaling Groups, Lambda Functions and cloudwatch events will be used in the project. The Auto Scaling groups are used to replace any lost instances automatically and maintain the required number of instances.
