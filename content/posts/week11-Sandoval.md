# Brian's Blog week 11

### This week's overview
This week started off well with meeting up with our group as well as the Computer Science and Information System teams. Currently we have set up a slack communications channel and have started bouncing ideas with how we can start setting our infrastructure while the computer science group will get more familiarized with .Net environment. We have voted to make Shahed our team leader we are currently just coming up with ideas of how we may implement some of the tools we have learned for this project.

Some issues we are currently facing that are preventing us from moving forward is that we currently do not have any credentials and with that any access to any of the infrastructure that is currently set up for the SAPS project. We will meet with Leo on Saturday who has been the leading person of this infrastructure. We as well were faced with an unexpected ultimatum from the Dr. Liu within the contract we need to fill out in order to get access so that we may use certain tools. Currently Wiegley has emailed him about this issue and are still awaiting a response to see if we can continue to work on this project. In the mean time to not waste much time I have been working with Erik on a rough diagram for how we may want this infrastructure to be set up. Currently we are as well working to see which model will allow us to save as much money as possible while at the same time providing the necessary functions that are required.
